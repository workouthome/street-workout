<p>Hi You can do yoga and exercise both as both have different purposes but do not over strain yourself. If you want to do yoga and exercise together to lose weight I would say that it is possible. This is because if you were to combine yoga. Yoga keeps you fit by improving circulation etc but you can build up muscles with yoga which can be done by pushups or with weights. But it may not be as effective as doing them separately. Pin On Pilates.</p>

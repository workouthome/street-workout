With six days to do rigorous workouts the Sabbath should probably be reserved for a slower pace or an opportunity to explain Gods creation through the natural world and with a desire to praise Him for His goodness. This is because there is a special mitzvah called Oneg Shabbat &ndash; which means a person should do what is enjoyable on Shabbat. Actually if a person is exercising for enjoyment it is permitted to exercise on Shabbat. The Sabbath is first and foremost a day of rest The word Sabbath.

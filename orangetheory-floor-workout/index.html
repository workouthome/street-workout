<p>Question - I have seen some spreadsheet gurus in here and I wonder if anyone out there happens to track some of our floor exercises. Focus on doing the exercises correctly rather than completing the rep count. Your coaches would should rather see 6 or 7 PERFECT reps rather than 5 mediocre reps and 5 sloppy reps because you wore yourself out just trying to get to 10.
